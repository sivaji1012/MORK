# Demonstrates: LTS (Labelled Transition System) state exploration,
# pre/post-condition actions, and hash-based state deduplication.

# Models a simple taxi cab on a 3×3 grid with a passenger.
# Actions: north/south/east/west (movement), pick-up, drop-off.
# State space explored via BFS fixpoint; states hashed for deduplication.
